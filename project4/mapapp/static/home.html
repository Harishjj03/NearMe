    <h2>VELLORE</h2>
    <h3>HOME TOWN</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Vellore, a historic city in Tamil Nadu, India, has a rich and diverse past that dates back centuries. It was ruled by several powerful dynasties, including the Pallavas, Cholas, Vijayanagara Empire, and later the Nawabs of Arcot.
        <br><br>
        The city's most iconic landmark, the Vellore Fort, was built in the 16th century by the Vijayanagara kings and is known for its impressive granite structure and blend of Dravidian and Islamic architecture. During the British colonial era, Vellore played a significant role, most notably in the 1806 Vellore Mutiny, one of the earliest uprisings against British rule. This revolt, led by Indian soldiers, was a precursor to the larger Indian independence movement. Over time, Vellore evolved into a major educational and medical hub, home to institutions like the Christian Medical College (CMC). Its layered history and cultural heritage continue to shape its identity today.
